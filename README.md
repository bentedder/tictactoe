Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a tic-tac-toe interface (AI) that never allows the challenger (user) to win.  

Constraints
-------------------------------------------
* The interface must look like a tic-tac-toe board (in whatever form you want to create)
* The interface should clearly indicate whose turn it is
* The game pieces should clearly reflect each player
* The AI must run entirely in the browser - no server-side logic
* Feel free to use any bootstrapping or other libraries you would like (we want you to have a lot of freedom here)

Evaluation Criteria
--------------------------------------------
Your solution will be judged on the following criteria, with the most important listed first.
* 100% coverage of all features and constraints listed above
* Code legibility.  This includes formatting, commenting, naming, and adherence to solid design patterns
* Error checking and error handling.
* Amount of time taken to return the assignment.
* Packaging and submission style.  You may submit this assignment via Git, JSfiddle, a tarball or zip, or any other means of submission you feel appropriate (though it is an evaluation criteria item).
