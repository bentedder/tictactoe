### About

This project was built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the view handler. It also uses the [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) pattern of unidirectional data flow. There is only one React component, with several sub-components.

The core of the AI of the app is a modification and expansion on the [Negamax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) (with alpha and beta pruning). Being my first experience with this formula, I leaned heavily on the experience of others and how they implemented it. There seem to be a lot of ways of going about it, but essentially it just traverses the tree of possible moves and adds values back up the chain for all winning or tie moves to tell the bot the optimal square to pick.

Loosely tested as far back IE9, and on most devices.

### Potential improvements
* Optimize a bit more for mobile. There are some click delays I'd get rid of. Had to turn off hover on smaller screens to avoid some issues on iOS. "Avoid", not get rid of. Another time.
* Consider simplifying the flux structure, as it may be overkill for this size of a project.
* Add a line or some indicator to the board to show the winning combination.
* Add a bit more user feedback (insults when they lose, ability to input their name, that kind of thing).
